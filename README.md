NetGauge is a privacy focused Network speed test client that tests against an M-Lab node and stores all runs in IndexedDb in the client's mobile browser. 

It is worth doing a second test run when you first start it as I notice the connection establishment means the first test run takes a hit.

It is possible to change themes to an Eink Theme that works well on Eink Devices such as Minimal Phone, LightPhone, Eink Tablets with web browser support etc.

The App is available directly as an installable PWA for a mobile browser at: https://jimliddle.github.io/NetGauge/
